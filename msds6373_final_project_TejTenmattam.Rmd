The following data set is a portion of the data taken from a study (Shumway 1988) on the possible effects of pollution and temperature on weekly Respiratory mortality in Los Angeles County. The dataset is called "lap" and is available from the astsa package. The goal of this project is to forecast 5 weeks of respiratory mortality beyond the 508 observations we were given.  

# 1.  (5 pts) Plot the respiratory mortality data you have.  
```{r, results="hide"}
# Import "lap" data
data(lap) 
# Convert to a time series data frame called RM
RM=data.frame(date=time(lap),Time=as.factor(seq(1,508,1)),as.matrix(lap))
# plot realization in RM along with sample autocorrelations, periodogram, and Parzen window-based spectral estimator
plotts.sample.wge(RM$rmort)
```

# 2. (5 pts) Comment on it’s stationarity or nonstationarity.
```{r}
# Checking for stationarity using plots:
# Condition 1: Subpopulations of RM$rmort for a given time have constant mean for all t.
# 𝐸[𝑋_𝑡 ]=𝜇
# The realization is pseudo-cyclic. The condition that mean does not depend on time is not met visually.

# Condition 2: Subpopulations of X for a given time have a constant and finite variance for all t. 
# Var[𝑋_𝑡]= 𝜎^2<∞ 
# Variance also does not appear constant because of the pseudo-cyclic behavior and spikes.

# Condition 3: The correlation of 𝑋_(𝑡_1 )and 𝑋_(𝑡_2 ) depends only on 𝑡_2− 𝑡_1. That is, the covariance between data points is dependent only on how far apart they are, not where they are. 
acf(RM$rmort[1:254])  
acf(RM$rmort[255:508])
# This condition has been met as the lags do not appear to be dependent on time as shown by the ACFs
acf(RM$rmort,lag.max = 104)
# Autocorrelations have a damped sinusoidal behavior with cycle length about 52, which is consistent with f0 = 0.019. Spectral density has a peak at about 1/52=0.019

# To verify a season of 52, I have also checked the factor table. 
est.ar.wge(RM$rmort,p=52,type='burg')
# Factor table also confirms a system frequency at 0.0190 with a complex conjugate root of "1.0015+-0.1204i" with absolute reciprocal of 0.9914.
# Another test for stationarity is Dickey Fuller test where H0: model has a root of +1 and HA: the model does not have a root of +1
adf.test(RM$rmort)
# The Dickey-Fuller test of 𝐻_0: the model has a unit root, is rejected (p-value=0.01)
# As per all the above evidence, I can say that the data is non-stationary. This is weekly data with a season of 52.
```

# 3a. (10 pts) Perform a univariate analysis using a) AR,ARMA, ARIMA, and/or ARUMA models (at least one). Also, clearly explain how you arrived at your final model.

# From the above plots. Particle counts and temperature are highly correlated with rmort (respiratory mortality). Whereas temperature and particles are not correlated (-0.0172) with each other. Based on this plot I can say that the predictors "temp"" and "particles"" are independent.

# Since the data is weekly, remove weekly trend
RM_rmort = artrans.wge(RM$rmort, c(rep(0,51),1))
# Now plot the transformed data

ASE
# ASE using ensemble model is 2.5998
```

# 3b. (5 pts) Compare these models and describe which univariate model you feel is the best and why.

With ARIMA Seasonal model using BIC I got an ASE of 3.4411. With neural network MLP model I got an ASE of 2.6766 and with the combined ensemble model, the ASE was 2.5998. All of these models have their ASE's very close and might perform better than one another if I try multiple seeds. Remembering George Box’s quote: All models are wrong but some are useful. With seed 2, the ensemble model has the lowest ASE and I will use that model for forecasts.

# 4c. (5 pts) Compare these models and describe which multivariate model you feel is the best and why.

With VAR model I got an ASE of 3.1057. With MLR correlated errors, I got an ASE of 3.8125 and with the combined multivariate ensemble model, the ASE was 1.6372. Remembering George Box’s quote: All models are wrong but some are useful. With seed 2, the ensemble model has the lowest ASE and I will use that model for forecasts.

# 5. (5 pts) Using the model you feel is most useful to forecasting the next 5 weeks of respiratory mortality 

I have picked the ensemble multivariate model of VAR and MLR correlated errors for forecasting the next 5 weeks of respiratory mortality. The decision to use this model was because of the lowest ASE of 1.6372.
